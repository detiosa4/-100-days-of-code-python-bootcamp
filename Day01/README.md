# Day 01: Band Name Generator ðŸŽ¸

Today I built a simple **Band Name Generator** in Python as part of Angela Yuâ€™s 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp.

---

### âœ… Concepts Practiced:
- `print()` statements
- `input()` to collect user data
- String concatenation
- Variables

---

### ðŸ’¡ What It Does:
The script asks the user for:
- The name of the city they grew up in
- Their pet's name

It then combines both to generate a fun band name.

ðŸ“Œ Example output:
Welcome to the Band Name Generator!
What's the name of the city you grew up in? Manchester
What's your pet's name? Shadow
Your band name could be: Manchester Shadow
