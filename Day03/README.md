# 100 Days of Code — Day 3 🐍

Today’s project: **Treasure Island** — a text-based adventure game built with Python!

---

## Topics covered:
- `if` / `elif` / `else` statements
- Nested `if` statements
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Comparison operators
- Combining multiple conditions
- Using `.lower()` to handle user input case-insensitively
- Debugging basic control flow

---

## What I built:
✅ **Treasure Island** — an interactive game where the player makes decisions to find hidden treasure or face various outcomes.

---

## What I learned:
- Got more comfortable writing and reading nested `if` statements.
- Learned how to break complex logic into smaller steps.
- Initially struggled with **nesting** and keeping track of indentation — now much clearer!
- Reinforced how control flow builds the core of interactive programs.
