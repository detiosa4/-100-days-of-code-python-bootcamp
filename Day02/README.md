## 📝 Project Description:
A simple **Tip Calculator** that helps users calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a chosen tip percentage.

The user provides:
1. Total bill amount 💵
2. Tip percentage to add (e.g. 10%, 12%, 15%) 🧮
3. Number of people splitting the bill 👥

The program then outputs the amount each person should pay, rounded to 2 decimal places.
