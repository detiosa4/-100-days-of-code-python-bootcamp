💻 100 Days of Code: Day 4
🚀 Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (Python)
Description
For Day 4 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, I built a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python.

The player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors by typing 0, 1, or 2, and then the computer randomly picks a choice. The game displays ASCII art for both choices and announces who wins.

Key Concepts Practiced
✅ List indexing
✅ If / Elif / Else statements
✅ Logical operators
✅ Random number generation
✅ User input & validation
✅ ASCII art display

How to Run
1️⃣ Clone the repo or copy the code.
2️⃣ Run with any Python 3.x environment (I used PyCharm).
3️⃣ Follow the on-screen instructions:

rust
Copy
Edit
Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors.
What I learned
✅ How to use random.randint() to generate random choices
✅ How to manage game state with lists
✅ Improved understanding of if / elif / else structure
✅ Fixed comparison errors (numbers vs strings!)
✅ Got better at debugging small logic bugs

Next Improvements
Add input error handling (if user types letters)

Loop the game for multiple rounds

Score tracking (Player vs Computer)

Better UI / UX
