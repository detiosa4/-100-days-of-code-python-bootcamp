Day 5 â€” Password Generator Project ðŸš€
#100DaysOfCode â€” Python Bootcamp (Angela Yu)

What I Built
Todayâ€™s project was a Password Generator written in Python.
I created two versions:

Easy Version â€” generates a readable password with random letters, numbers, and symbols (but in order).

Hard Version â€” generates a strong password where characters are randomized (shuffled), making it harder to guess or crack.

What I Learned
âœ… How to use for loops and range()
âœ… How to combine different lists of characters
âœ… How to shuffle lists with random.shuffle()
âœ… How to build more secure passwords
âœ… How to handle user input and improve logic

Challenges
Getting the shuffle to work correctly for the hard version

Making sure the password length matches user input

Keeping the code readable and simple

Next Steps
Explore using functions to make the code reusable

Add input validation

Try making a GUI version with Tkinter in the future!
